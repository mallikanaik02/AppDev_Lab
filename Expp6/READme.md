# Experiment 1: JS/TS CRUD on Array

## Aim
To implement and demonstrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on JavaScript arrays.

## Steps Followed

1. **Set up development environment:**
   - Installed Node.js for JavaScript runtime
   - Created project folder and opened command terminal
   - Verified Node.js installation with `node -v`

2. **Created JavaScript file:**
   - Created `crud.js` file using Notepad
   - Saved file in the project directory

3. **Implemented CRUD operations:**
   - **CREATE:** Added new items to array using `push()` method
   - **READ:** Displayed array contents using `console.log()`
   - **UPDATE:** Modified existing array elements using index assignment
   - **DELETE:** Removed elements using `splice()` method

4. **Executed the program:**
   - Ran the JavaScript file using `node crud.js` command
   - Captured console output showing all CRUD operations


## Expected Output

When the program runs, the console displays:
- Initial array with sample data
- Array after adding new item (CREATE operation)
- Current array contents (READ operation)
- Array after updating an existing item (UPDATE operation)
- Array after removing an item (DELETE operation)
- Final array state
